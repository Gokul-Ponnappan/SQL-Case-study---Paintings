Introduction:

The SQL Case Study Project presents a comprehensive analysis of a dataset through 17 carefully crafted questions.
Utilizing a combination of Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands and advanced SQL techniques, the project delves into various aspects of data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis.
Objective:

The primary objective of the project is to showcase proficiency in SQL querying techniques and demonstrate the ability to derive insights from a given dataset.
By addressing 17 specific questions, the project aims to provide meaningful analysis and valuable insights into the underlying data.
Methodology:

The project utilizes a variety of SQL commands, including DML commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE for data manipulation.
Advanced SQL techniques such as Window Functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and Joins are employed to enhance the depth and complexity of the analysis.
Each question is approached systematically, utilizing appropriate SQL constructs to retrieve, filter, aggregate, and analyze the data effectively.
Key Features:

DML Commands: Utilized for basic data manipulation tasks such as retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion of data.
Window Functions: Employed to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, enabling advanced analytical capabilities.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Used to create temporary result sets, enhancing readability and modularity of SQL queries.
Joins: Leveraged to combine data from multiple tables, facilitating complex data analysis and insights generation.
Project Structure:

The project is structured around 17 distinct questions, each targeting a specific aspect of the dataset.
Questions are organized logically, progressing from basic exploratory analysis to more complex analytical tasks.
SQL queries are accompanied by clear explanations and annotations to elucidate the thought process and methodology employed.
